# Hi everyone! 
## My name is Aleksandra and I'm coming from Ukraine!

_I currently live in Haasdonk, a little village located between Antwerp and Gent. I moved to Belgium one year ago and all the year kept myself busy with studying Dutch._

And now I'm super happy to be a part of an amazing project **HackYourFuture!**
Hopefully we all make it to the end and find our place in the world of web developers and software enginiers :smirk:

### My two biggest hobbies are:
* Yoga
* Travelling

**_I wish you all good luck and hope to see you soon in person!_**
