# State

At their simplest, __apps__ are just _user interactions_ with _data_.  "State" is a fancy way to say "the data stored in my program __right now__".  Understanding your programs as a series of states, and being able to _inspect_ & _predict_ that state are THE fundamental skills necessary for effective programming & debugging.

Aside from becoming a killer programmer, learning to think of your programs as _data_ first and _code_ second will enable you to plan your projects with __User Stories__, or more simply - what users can do with your data!
